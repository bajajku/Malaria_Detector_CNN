## Introduction

Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite and a major health concern worldwide, and correct diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This repository provides a tool for malaria diagnosis by utilizing an Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify cell samples as either infected or uninfected. 

# Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found at [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N1gcN8_5dZVlIejoC00QZLSZFhGoSoQb/view]. This dataset consists of cell feature data, including attributes such as cell size, shape, and other relevant characteristics.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, you'll need Python and several libraries. You can create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies using the following commands:
Clone the repository
git clone -[ https://github.com/bajajku/Cancer_Classification_Project.git](https://github.com/bajajku/Malaria_Detector_CNN.git)
cd Malaria_CNN

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirementss.txt

## Usage

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can use the model for cancer classification. Here are the steps to follow:

 1) Data Preparation: Ensure you have access to the dataset, and the data is preprocessed appropriately. This may include cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.

 2) Training the Model: Train the ANN model using the provided dataset or your custom dataset. See the Training section for details on how to train the model.

 3) Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and other relevant metrics (see Evaluation).

## Model Architecture

The architecture of the Artificial Neural Network used for cancer classification consists of several layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. The exact architecture may vary depending on the dataset and problem complexity. A typical architecture includes:

  1)Input Layer: Accepts the cell feature data as input.
  2)Hidden Layers: One or more hidden layers with multiple neurons to extract patterns and features. Generally Con2D and MaxPool2D is used.
  3)Output Layer: Provides the final classification as parasitized or unparasitized. Activation functionused is sigmoid.

The activation functions, optimizer, and loss function are selected based on the problem requirements.

## Training

Training the model involves the following steps:

  1.Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by cleaning, normalizing, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

  2.Model Configuration: Define the CNN architecture, including the number of layers and neurons, activation functions, and other hyperparameters.

  5.Model Training: Train the model using the training dataset. Monitor the loss and accuracy during training.

  4.Model Saving: Save the trained model for later use.

For detailed code and instructions on training the model, refer to the documentation or code files in the repository.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance, use a separate testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics for binary classification tasks like this one include classification report, confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify parasitized and unparasitized cells images.

##Deployment

Deploying the model for real-world use involves integrating it into a production environment. This can be done through various methods, including web applications, APIs, or mobile applications. Ensure that the model is accessible and can provide predictions on new cell samples efficiently.
